**Tech ðŸ’»**

Astro, Typescript, Spotify API

**Description ðŸ“–**

An astro plugin/template, built using their integrations API and WAAPI.

Every year I update my personal website, almost a recap of my progress over a period of time.

**Future work ðŸ•¥**

Build a studio (Github Sync support). Add AstroDB, I would also like to give Keystatic a try, with the github mode specifically for managing collections.
