**Tech ðŸ’»**

Astro, Typescript, Spotify API

**Description ðŸ“–**

An astro plugin/template, built using their integrations API and WAAPI.

Every year I update my personal website, almost a recap of the year.

**Future work ðŸ•¥**

Build a studio. Add AstroDB, I would also like to Keystatic a try, specifically because it has a github mode as a way to manage my collections.
