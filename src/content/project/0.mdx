I love learning trough my (sometimes over-engineered) side-quests. Right now, I’m diving into Golang and deepening my understanding of how databases work.

My main stack is TypeScript and React, but I’m always experimenting with whatever catches my interest.

Lately, I’ve been using Figma a lot and exploring how to tell my dev stories through video.
