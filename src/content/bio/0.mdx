Hi, my name is Khaya 👋🏽, a full-stack TypeScript developer from Johannesburg, South Africa.

If I'm not coding you will probably find me watching South African comedy or playing indoor football ⚽️.

This is my personal website built with an Astro plugin I wrote called [Builder](https://builder-www-bice.vercel.app/)
