**Tech 💻**

NextJS, ViteJS, Supabase, Snaplet

**Description 📖**

A changelog makes the perfect candidate for a static site generator. Which I was try to build when exploring Astro’s integration’s API. Changesaw is an Astro plugin that turns your content collections into Changelogs.

**Future work 🕥**

Inspired by Starlight & Docusaurus. This project is still a work in progress (which is a recurring theme at this point). I guess what I really want to try out is a GitHub action for open source repo’s. Using an OpenAI key to auto generate logs from releases.

Astro also just released a theme for a Changelog, called [Starlog](https://astro.build/themes/details/starlog/). So don't use Changesaw, Starlog offers a lot more customization and generally cleaner visually.
