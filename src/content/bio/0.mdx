Hi, I’m **Khaya** 👋 a full-stack engineer. I was born in November. 🍁

**Fun fact:** my brother is one year younger than me, we're both born in month, wait for it… on the same day!

I’m currently working at a devtools startup called [Snaplet](https://www.snaplet.dev/). Using AI, to make it easy & safe for teams to work with production data, in their dev environments.

I'll be honest, I haven't figured out everything, but hoping to have fun, with the intention of getting there.

I hope my personal website helps you learn about my travels (a short but sweet list 😂), concerts & taste in music and finally my sometimes uneducated perspective of Africa, building tools and I guess life.

**Welcome.**
